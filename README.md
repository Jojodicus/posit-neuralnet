# PositNN

Framework in C++ for Deep Learning (training and testing) using <a href="https://posithub.org/" target="_blank">Posits</a>.
The posits are emulated with <a href="https://github.com/stillwater-sc/universal" target="_blank">stillwater-sc/universal</a> library and the deep learning is based in <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>.

This is being developed for a thesis to obtain a Master of Science Degree in Aerospace Engineering.

## Installation

### Requirements

- <a href="https://github.com/gonced8/universal" target="_blank">Fork from stillwater-sc/universal: gonced8/universal</a>
- <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" target="_blank">PyTorch for C++ (LibTorch)</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/hpc-ulisboa/posit-neuralnet" target="_blank">PositNN (this library)</a>
- cmake >= v3
- gcc >= v5
- glibc >= v2.17

### Setup

- Clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hpc-ulisboa/posit-neuralnet.git
```

- Clone gonced8/universal repository inside include folder
```shell
cd posit-neuralnet/include
git clone https://github.com/gonced8/universal.git
```

- Download appropriate PyTorch for C++ (LibTorch) and unzip also inside include folder

<a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" target="_blank">https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/</a>

## Features
- Use any posit configuration
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
- Layers: Batch Normalization, Convolution, Dropout, Linear (Fully-Connected), Pooling (average and max)
- Loss functions: Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error
- Optimizer: SGD
- Tensor class: StdTensor
- Parallelization: multithreading with std::thread

## Usage
- Adjust the CMakeLists.txt inside examples and adapt to your setup, namely, the directories of universal/PositNN/Torch, and number of threads
- Build your project/example, execute this in the example/project folder:
```shell
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/libtorch"
$ make
```
## Tests

To check if everything is installed correctly, you can try one of the examples. The following steps describe how to test the mnist_fcnn example.

- Go to the project folder
```shell
cd examples/mnist_fcnn
```
- (Optional) Edit CMakeLists.txt to your configuration. Configure positnn and universal path. The one given assumes that they are both inside the include folder at the repository root directory, that is, from your current path:
```shell
../../include
../../include/universal/include
```
- Build the project. Specify absolute path to PyTorch (LibTorch) folder. This example assumes that the folder is also inside the include folder.
```shell
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/home/gonced8/posit-neuralnet/include/libtorch"
make
```

- Run program. If you're saving the models, make sure the appropriate output folder exists.
```shell
./train_posit
```

  abstract    = {Low-precision formats have proven to be an efficient way to reduce not only the memory footprint but also the hardware resources and power consumption of deep learning computations. Under this premise, the posit numerical format appears to be a highly viable substitute for the IEEE floating-point, but its application to neural networks training still requires further research. Some preliminary results have shown that 8-bit (and even smaller) posits may be used for inference and 16-bit for training, while maintaining the model accuracy. The presented research aims to evaluate the feasibility to train deep convolutional neural networks using posits. For such purpose, a software framework was developed to use simulated posits and quires in end-to-end training and inference. This implementation allows using any bit size, configuration, and even mixed precision, suitable for different precision requirements in various stages. The obtained results suggest that 8-bit posits can substitute 32-bit floats during training with no negative impact on the resulting loss and accuracy.},
